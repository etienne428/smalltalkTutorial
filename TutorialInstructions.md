# Abstract
This is a description of the first steps for this Smalltalk tutorial. No previous knowledge is needed, although some basic programming skills (not necessarily in the Smalltalk language) will help understanding.

# Requierement
Git should be installed on your device.
You will need an internet connection to clone this repository and download Pharo (see first step).

# First step
Smalltalk has many dialects. I chose Pharo for this project.
Pharo is a modern version of Smalltalk that comes with an IDE including all whats needed to write, run and debug code.First you have to download [Pharo](https://pharo.org/download). Please carefully read the instrucationson the official page. Please follow the next instruction when you have the Pharo Launcher.

# Launch your image
Select New on the top left corner. In 'Official Distribution', select 'Pharo 8.0 - XXbit (stable)' (where XX stands for 32 or 64), and 'create image'. On the top bar, select 'Launch', which will open a new window. You should see something like that :

Know, you have to clone this repository. Open the 'Tool' menu that you find by a left-click on the background (alternatively, you can find it on the top bar menu). Select 'Iceberg', 'Add' then 'clone remote repository'. Enter the URL and select a Local Directory on your computer where will lie your copy (the default option is probably the best one) and click 'Ok'.

If the status is not 'Up to date', right-click on the line and select 'Packages'. In the window that just opened, right-click on the 'Tutorial' package and select '+ Load'. You can now close this window, as well as the 'Repository'.

You know need to open a Playground. On the same 'Tool' menu, select 'Playground'. There, write "LearnSmalltalk start." and press the doit button (the green triangle on the top right).

Here you go, you've reached the tutorial! Follow carefully the instructions, and enjoy my tutorial!
