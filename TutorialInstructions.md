# Abstract
This is a description of the first steps for this Smalltalk tutorial. No previous knowledge is needed, although some basic programming skills (not necessarily in the Smalltalk language) will help understanding.

# Requierement
Git should be installed on your device.
You will need an internet connection to clone this repository and download Pharo (see first step).

# First step
Smalltalk has many dialects. I chose Pharo for this project.
Pharo is a modern version of Smalltalk that comes with an IDE including all whats needed to write, run and debug code.First you have to download [Pharo](https://pharo.org/download). Please carefully read the instrucationson the official page. Please follow the next instruction when you have the Pharo Launcher.
