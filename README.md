# Abstract
This is a repository containing my programming project, a tutorial for Smalltalk (in its Pharo dialekt)

# Use
To run this project, one first  has to download [Pharo](https://pharo.org/download). I also used the [Iceberg](https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg/wiki/Tutorial), which is a build-in git tool. 

# State
The programm is not yet runnable, this is just a first step to be sure the sharing method is suitable
